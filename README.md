## What's in this repo? ü§î
This is a personal project, which I've picked up to strengthen my understanding of UI/UX design, front-end and back-end development, CI/CD concepts and Azure DevOps overall. Therefore, it will contain experimental (and sometimes irrelevant) commits. 
In other words, this projects includes the "how sausage is made". See the [Design Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/eldoOvMa18nKAt82cbwCLy/Draft-1?node-id=196-10&t=cdY3LsLitlHvIgix-1) to see the endgoal of this app.

_Warning:_ The main repository is stored in an Azure DevOps repository, since I am trying to learn Azure-based tools. This is just a mirror of the main repo, made to share with the public.
